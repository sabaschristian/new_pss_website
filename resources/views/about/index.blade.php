                            The Passionist Sisters of St. Paul of the Cross is founded by <strong>Maria Maddalena Frescobaldi</strong>,
                            She was born in Florence (Italy) on November 11, 1771. Her parents were Giuseppe Frescobaldi and Giuseppa Quaratesi, one of the noble families in Florence.
                            At the age of eleven, she was sent by her parents to the nearby convent in town in order to study. The convent became her boarding school.

                            At the age of nineteen, Maria Maddalena was married family. Maria Maddalena and Roberto Capponi, who also came from an illustrious paternal wealth but also
                            because of their civil affiliation with the Grand Duke Fernando III at the court of Tuscany. Both of them have a profound witness of their Christian life.

                            The family status however, did not spare Maria Maddalena from experiencing great sorrow. This was caused by a successive death of her three daughters,
                            leaving Gino her only son. For her it was a deep experience of pain with the suffering mothers. It was through these experiences that Maria Maddalena unites all things
                            to the Passion and Death of our Lord Jesus.

                            In 1814, Maria Maddalena met Pope Plus VII in Imola to whom she explained her plan and her inspiration towards the young people.

                            On March 17, 1815, on the significant Good Friday, Maria Maddalena founded her new institution called The Handmalds of the Passion. This institution was dedicated to educate,
                            to set an example, and to bring the "Ignorant souls" back to the love of God. The first Handmaids were: Sr. Gertrude Vitali, Sr. Cleofe Baroni, Sr. Veronica Tulini, and Sr. Crocifissa Bucarin.
