                        The Passionist Sisters of St. Paul of the Cross is founded by <strong>Maria Maddalena Frescobaldi</strong>,
                        She was born in Florence (Italy) on November 11, 1771. Her parents were Giuseppe Frescobaldi and Giuseppa Quaratesi, one of the noble families in Florence.
                        At the age of eleven, she was sent by her parents to the nearby convent in town in order to study. The convent became her boarding school.

                        At the age of nineteen, Maria Maddalena was married family. Maria Maddalena and Roberto Capponi, who also came from an illustrious paternal wealth but also
                        because of their civil affiliation with the Grand Duke Fernando III at the court of Tuscany. Both of them have a profound witness of their Christian life.

                        The family status however, did not spare Maria Maddalena from experiencing great sorrow. This was caused by a successive death of her three daughters,
                        leaving Gino her only son. For her it was a deep experience of pain with the suffering mothers. It was through these experiences that Maria Maddalena unites all things
                        to the Passion and Death of our Lord Jesus.

                        When the french Revolution broke out in 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy. Pier Roberto Capponi, the Commander in chief of the Grand Duchess (Luisa Amalia), was
                        exiled together with the Grand Duke. Maria Maddalena was left alone with Gino, bearing the bitter separation from her husband. The Capponi palace in Florence was sequestered
                        by the French troops, leaving Maria Maddalena at the mercy of God.
